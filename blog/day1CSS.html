        approach stands out and how his tutorials have helped me grasp CSS
        fundamentals and beyond.</p> <p>Kevin Powell is the perfect starting point for
        this series. He’s known for making CSS concepts easy to understand and
        providing valuable tips on creating responsive, beautifully designed
        websites. Whether you’re a beginner or looking to refine your skills,
        his YouTube channel has something for everyone. Here’s why I think Kevin

      <h3>Why Kevin Powell??</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Beginner-Friendly and Advanced Content </strong>:<br />
          Kevin's tutorials cater to all levels of learners. Whether you’re a
          complete beginner or an intermediate coder looking to sharpen your
          skills, there’s content for everyone. He walks you through the basics
          like selectors, properties, and the box model, but he also delves into
          more advanced topics like CSS Grid, Flexbox, and animations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Practical, Real-World Projects </strong>: <br />One of the
          things I love most about Kevin’s tutorials is the focus on practical
          projects. Instead of just explaining concepts, he shows you how to
          apply them. From creating beautiful navigation menus to designing
          responsive websites, you can follow along and build projects that you
          can use in your own portfolio.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Responsive Design Focus</strong>: <br />Kevin is a big
          advocate for responsive design, and rightly so. In his tutorials, he
          teaches you how to ensure your websites look great on all devices,
          from desktops to mobile phones. This includes covering essential
          techniques like media queries and flexible layouts using CSS Grid and
          Flexbox.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Favorite Tutorials So Far:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Mastering CSS Flexbox</strong><br />
          Flexbox is often seen as confusing for beginners, but Kevin's
          step-by-step explanations make it easy to grasp. His tutorials on
          Flexbox are super clear, and after following them, I finally felt
          confident using Flexbox in my own projects.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Responsive Web Design with & WITHOUT Media Queries </strong
          ><br />
          One of Kevin's insights that has always resonated with me is when he
          said, "Websites naturally want to be responsive." By this, he means
          that websites are inherently flexible, and the more we impose strict
          heights, widths, and other constraints, the more we disrupt that
          natural responsiveness, often creating unnecessary complications.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>CSS Grid: Build a Responsive Layout</strong><br />
          Learning CSS Grid can feel overwhelming at first, but Kevin breaks it
          down beautifully. In one of his series, he walks you through building
          a responsive layout from scratch using CSS Grid, making it a breeze to
          understand.

      <h3>Take Your Time</h3>

      <p>
        That’s my current take on learning CSS with the help of Kevin Powell’s
        YouTube channel. CSS has alot of deep layors that take time to learn. I
        would recomend spending at least a month dedicated to only CSS. Kevin
        has plenty of tutorials to keep you busy for that week. An important
        thing to remember is CSS is always improving, there is alot to learn, so
        take your time and have fun!
