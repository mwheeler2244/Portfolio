      <p>
        FreeCodeCamp offers a comprehensive and engaging course that serves as
        an excellent introduction to HTML, making it accessible for beginners
        and a refreshing resource for those looking to brush up on their skills.

      <h3>What to Expect from the HTML Course</h3>
      <p>
        FreeCodeCamp’s HTML curriculum is designed to be interactive and
        hands-on. You’ll start with the basics, learning how to structure a web
        page using various HTML elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and
        lists. The course provides a clear understanding of the syntax and
        semantics of HTML, allowing you to create well-structured documents. One
        of the standout features of FreeCodeCamp is its project-based approach.
        As you progress, you’ll have the opportunity to apply what you’ve
        learned by building real projects. This not only reinforces your
        understanding but also helps you create a portfolio of work that
        showcases your new skills. Projects include creating a personal
        portfolio page, a survey form, and even a tribute page, which all serve
        to solidify your understanding of HTML.

        The interactive coding environment allows you to write and test your
        HTML code in real-time. This immediate feedback is invaluable as you
        learn, helping you identify and correct mistakes as you go.
        Additionally, FreeCodeCamp’s well-structured lessons are supplemented
        with detailed explanations and examples, making complex concepts easier
        to grasp.
