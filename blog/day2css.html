      <h3>What You’ll Learn from Dave Gray’s CSS Full Course</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Introduction to CSS</strong>:<br />
          Dave starts with the essentials—what CSS is and how to link it to HTML
          files. He explains selectors, properties, and values in a way that's
          easy to follow, making it a great entry point for beginners.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Text Styling</strong>: <br />
          You’ll explore different ways to style text, learning how to modify
          fonts, sizes, weights, and colors. Dave shows how to apply custom
          fonts to your website using web fonts, enhancing the visual appeal of
          your pages.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Layouts with Flexbox and Grid</strong>: <br />
          One of the highlights of the course is its thorough coverage of
          Flexbox and CSS Grid. These modern layout techniques are essential for
          building responsive web designs. Dave breaks down each method,
          demonstrating how to create layouts that adapt seamlessly across
          devices.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Responsive Design</strong>: <br />Dave delves into responsive
          design by teaching how to use media queries to adjust layouts based on
          screen size. He explains how to ensure your designs look great on
          everything from large desktop monitors to small mobile screens.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>CSS Animations and Transitions</strong>: <br />
          If you’re looking to make your websites more interactive, Dave covers
          CSS animations and transitions. You’ll learn how to create smooth
          effects that improve user experience, from hover effects to keyframe
          animations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Project-Based Learning</strong>: <br />
          Throughout the course, Dave emphasizes practical projects. You’ll code
          along with him, building real-world designs and applying the concepts
          you've learned in real-time. This hands-on approach helps solidify
          your CSS skills.

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Free and Accessible:</strong><br />
